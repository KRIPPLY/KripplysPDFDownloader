USER INSTRUCTIONS:
The software will open an automated instance of Chrome Browser for you.
In the automated Chrome Browser, navigate to the pdf you want to download.
From there, return to the terminal and follow the on screen instructions.
If your internet connection is slow, try adjusting the delay in settings/delay.txt.
Adjusting the delay tells the downloader to wait longer for the page to render before attempting to download it.
At the end of the download, the PDF will be compiled and placed in the "PDF - OUTPUT" folder.

Note:
You can either compile a PDF from the raw (uncompressed) pages or compress them.
If you plan on using an OCR tool for text recognition, it is recommended to leave the pages uncompressed.
